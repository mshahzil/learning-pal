# LearningPal
A web application that allows you to search for online courses, view their details and lessons, and enroll in the courses you like. It allows users to register on the website in order to keep track of the enrolled courses and the progress in each course. Registered users can provide feedback on the courses and they can also view and edit their own profile (name, profile picture, password, etc). Users can contact the admin in case of any queries or suggestions through a contact form. The website has an admin portal that allows the admin to view, add, edit and delete courses, lessons, and users. The admin has the rights for deleting a feedback but not editing one. Admin can change their login password through the admin portal.
